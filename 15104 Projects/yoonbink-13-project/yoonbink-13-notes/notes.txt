Go to the file and open the html to run the program. This is only instruction to run the current version as I didn’t implement the user interaction yet. As of now, I’ve used helper functions and conditionals to make Kirby move in a certain way at the right time. Also, a for loop was implemented to execute Kirby shooting multiple splashes at his enemy “king”. 
However, there are multiple features that are yet implemented. First are the arrays of image files and transformation of characters. I’m planning to make the king to be defeated by Kirby and fly away while his body is rotating – In this scene, rotation and scale are going to be used.
Second, Kirby’s elements such as Kirby's size and his speed would be stored in an object Kirby. 
Also, I’ll add keyboard interaction to control Kirby's position, allowing users to be part of this animation; the project won’t have an overwhelming amount of user interaction, to be distinguished from the concept of the game. Lastly, I’ll add sounds when Kirby is jumping, fighting an enemy, or any other actions were made, enhancing the liveliness of the animation.
I’m not facing any challenges until now since I’m familiar with creating short animation as I did similar concept work for Project 10. However, it would be helpful if I can get help on how I can apply more complex concepts such as recursion in my project. Also, while I’m using found images for the visual, would it be better if I create my own visual component to add my personal touch? Do you think impact of water on living life, kirby in this case, is well represented through the animation?
